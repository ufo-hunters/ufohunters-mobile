                        <p id="description">Disappearing strobing spiraling lights that split into two lights!A blue light appeared west of white swan slightly above the hill ridgeline. It would get very bright, then dissapear. It came back a green color, got bright again, and dissapeared once again. It reappeared yellow, split into two, and they began spiraling clockwise. They formed back into one, and disappeared.At times it pulsed and gave off an enormous amount of light. It was also in front of the clouds. It eventually lowered in the clouds before the light disappeared.My girlfriend and niece were frightened by it and ran into the house and started crying. Ive never seen anything like it. Yellow white lights in the sky turned an orange color and accelerated at a tremendous speed.My son and I were in the vicinity of Fort and Campbell Road near Wapato Wa and traveling west. My son said hey look airplanes following each other. We then observed two yellow white lights in the sky a few miles ahead of us traveling south at a slow rate of speed. The light in front turned an orange color and accelerated at a tremendous rate of speed and headed south east. The second light turned orange and followed until both were out of sight.</p>
